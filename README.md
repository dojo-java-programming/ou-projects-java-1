__WARNING:__

[Install the Java libraries (jars)](lib/README.md) into the local Maven repository, before importing the projects
of the course as Maven projects.

## Introduction

At the [Open Universiteit](https://www.ou.nl/) there is a course about [ObjectgeoriÃ«nteerd programmeren in Java 1](https://www.ou.nl/web/studieaanbod/home?p_p_id=storefront_portlet_WAR_storefront&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-4&p_p_col_count=1&_storefront_portlet_WAR_storefront__spage=/SelectProd.do?prodSku=T25151&_storefront_portlet_WAR_storefront_prodSku=T25151).

### Original Samples as Eclipse Projects

This project contains the original samples from the course material. They are located in the __master__ branch. These 
contain _Eclipse Projects_ specific files like `.project`, `.classpath` and sometime a directory `.settings`. 

### Samples as Maven Projects

The same samples are also available as one _Maven Project_ (containing a Maven module, for each sample). This shows an
example of Maven. Which is a good subject to study, when learning Java. They are available under the branch __maven__.

### Why on GitHub ?

When learning Java and creating new projects, it is good to see how other do that. One of the first tool one need, is
Source Code Management (SCM). It makes the live of an developer a lot easier, even when working on your own. Going back
in history, trying out new things, is easy when working with an SCM. Let alone when working with multiple developers
together on project(s). And the SCM tool these days to know is _git_.
